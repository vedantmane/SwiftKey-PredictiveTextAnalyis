# SwiftKey-PredictiveTextAnalyis
Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain. SwiftKey builds a smart keyboard that makes it easier for people to type on their mobile devices. One cornerstone of their smart keyboard is predictive text models. 

## Project Overview
We will use our knowledge of Data Science in order to clean and analyze data, building and sampling predictive text models and finally use basics of Natural Language Processing for predicting text output from users in order for them to type on their mobile devices with ease.
